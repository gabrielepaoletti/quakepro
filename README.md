# QUAKEPRO: earthQUAKE Processing and Retrieval Operations

An open-source, user-friendly tool designed to streamline the entire workflow of seismological data handling —- from downloading seismic waveforms to processing and visualization. Developed for researchers and enthusiasts in seismology, QUAKEPRO integrates data retrieval, processing, and visualization into a cohesive framework, enhancing efficiency and ease of use.

## ✨ Features

- 📥 **Automated data retrieval:** Seamlessly download seismic waveforms using FDSN web services directly from CSV earthquake catalogs.
- ⚙️ **Customized downloads:** Perform detrending, resampling, and response removal to prepare waveforms for analysis.
- 🔄 **Post-Processing:** Apply tapering, filtering (and more soon...) to the downloaded waveforms for further refinement and analysis.
- 📊 **Advanced visualization:** Generate plots of waveforms, spectra, spectrograms (and more soon...) to aid in the interpretation and presentation of seismic data.
- 🧩 **Modular design:** The class-based structure ensures ease of use, allowing functions to automatically link and process data without manual intervention, simplifying the workflow.
